Python color-selection toolkit for the generation of infographics.

I started to practice making infographics, but selecting colors that gradiate proportionally to a percentage (like a statistic) was difficult, so I opted to write a python script to do the job for me.

First time building a practical application of Python, will continue to work on optimizing past scripts.

### Current library

+ **percent-color.py** will prompt for a color to indicate 100%, and then ask for the percentage to be colored. It outputs a hex value. The higher the percentage, the darker the color.

### To-do

+ New script: gradiate between two colors, for example shift from red to green.

+ Optimize old scripts.
